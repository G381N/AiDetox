<ul>
  <li>2 or 3 large eggs</li>
  <li>1 tbsp butter or oil</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Prepare the eggs: Crack the eggs into a medium bowl. Add salt and pepper. Whisk the eggs well until the mixture is a consistent color. If using fillings like onions or mushrooms, you can either mix them into the raw egg mixture (for faster cooking and a softer texture) or sauté them in the pan first (for a more browned, tender result).</li>
  <li>Heat the pan: Heat the butter or oil in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Make sure the pan is well-coated.</li>
  <li>Cook the omelette: Pour the egg mixture into the pan. As the edges begin to set, use a spatula to gently lift the cooked egg, allowing the uncooked egg to flow underneath and cook evenly.</li>
  <li>Add fillings: When the top is still a little shiny but not runny, sprinkle any solid fillings (like pre-cooked veggies or cheese) over one half of the omelette.</li>
  <li>Fold and serve: Carefully fold the omelette in half over the filling with the spatula. Cook for another minute until the cheese is melted and the egg is fully set. Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
