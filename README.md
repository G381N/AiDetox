# AiDetox — My daily coding practice

This is my repo for practicing coding every day.

- I do one small problem most days (about 10–30 minutes).
- I try to solve it myself first, then look for hints if I get stuck.
- I log one short line: `YYYY-MM-DD • problem • time • result`.

Yes — I let a little AI help write this README, but the practice is mine. 😉

Simple goal: do one problem today. Repeat tomorrow. 🚀

Hope this goes well ...🤞
